<!--
  This HTML page loads a 3D model and allows users to view it in 3D and
  Augmented Reality (AR) using the <model-viewer> web component. The
  page imports the model-viewer library from an external CDN and
  references the GLB file that was provided by the user. On
  AR‑enabled devices (for example, Android phones with ARCore), an
  AR button will appear. When the user taps that button, the model
  appears in their real environment via WebXR or the Scene Viewer app
  depending on the device and browser.【107675906576534†L506-L552】

  Note: To enable AR on iOS devices, the model must also be provided
  as a USDZ file. Since only a GLB file is available, AR is
  supported on Android devices. If you convert the model to USDZ,
  you can add an `ios-src` attribute pointing to that file.

  <!--
    The model-viewer tag below loads the GLB file and enables AR when
    the `ar` attribute is present. On supported devices, an AR button
    will appear automatically. The `camera-controls` attribute lets
    users rotate and zoom the model on the web page, and `auto-rotate`
    slowly spins the model for a better initial presentation. The
    `ar-modes` attribute specifies the AR runtimes that may be used:
    'webxr' for WebXR-enabled browsers, 'scene-viewer' for the
    Google Scene Viewer app on Android, and 'quick-look' for Apple's
    Quick Look (requires a USDZ file).【107675906576534†L543-L552】
